-----------------------------------------------

    It's true... Now users can install 
OpenTTY using pip: 'pip install opentty' and
to open it 'python -m opentty' or downloading/
creating profiles to personalize your experience
with OpenTTY.

    Dont forget of use 'inbox' to read the
menssages and update your OpenTTY installed 
version. If you just download app file use 'sync'
and for pip users run command 'upgrade' or in
terminal run 'pip install opentty --upgrade'
