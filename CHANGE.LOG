OpenTTY 1.1.1 "The ROOT Update"

	In this release Mr. Lima had fixed many
bugs with permission plugin like sync in 1.1
doesnt works 'cause PSH didnt sent information
for app that it was running with superuser 
permission. 

1. Fixed SYNC Permission denied.

	In 1.1 command sync was blocked for root
only, but PSH didnt sent the superuser config
for applet and it cant be runned. To upgrade
from 1.1 to 1.1.1 run command:

	'pip install --upgrade opentty'

	It will update your local version of opentty
to PyPi latest release. Dont remember to update,
it become your experience with opentty better and
bring more security for users. 

2. Now command not found error stop script execution

	Command continue excuting after a unknown 
command report is a "bug" in code, it was forgotted
by Mr. Lima since 1.0rc4 the first official release
at PyPi.
