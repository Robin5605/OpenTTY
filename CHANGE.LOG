OpenTTY 1.1 "The ROOT Update"

	In this version OpenTTY move all installation
support for Pypi and was implemented Permission Plugin
at OpenTTY PSH Client, it turn better whitelist control
and add command 'SUDO' that works like *nix systems, it
run utilities with superuser permission.

1. Running scripts with Whitelist and ROOT
	
	Everybody knows that to run and build scripts in
OpenTTY it need be in Whitelist, but now you can use
'SUDO' to run, build and install it without put this
file in whitelist.

	Example:

		If you try run a python script in OpenTTY env:

		After:
			$ . script.py
			.: permission denied.

		Now: 
			$ sudo . script.py
			< script is running >

	It help who have a most commum filename as 'file.py' or
'test.py' and cant put this file at whitelist, but it will
run the script with superuser permission what can be bad if
you dont trust totally in developer(s).

2. Commands that now requires ROOT Permissions
	
	To control more uses of applications, now the commands:

	- INSTALL "Install third assets"
	- SYNC    "Update OpenTTY local installation"
	- VENV    "Create profiles"
	- GET     "Install assets from mirrors"
	- INSMOD  "Build a Shell Script"
	- SERVER  "Open a localhost server"

	It add more security for machine admins blocking invaders
actions as use 'SERVER' to acess your files by other machine 
and 'INSTALL' to modify and add assets that make bad things at
your device.
 
3. The OpenTTY Session authenticator

	Now you can enable the security authenticator, it can be
enabled in profile settings charging "library['do-auth']" for
True and the next time that you try open PSH will require password
and if anyone insert password incorrectly it will be ended session
with exception PermissionError
